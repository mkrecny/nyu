<p>
I don’t buy books in bookshops anymore. I stopped about 7 years ago when I was given my first Kindle for Christmas. These days I don’t even use a physical Kindle, just the Kindle app on my iPhone. 
</p>

<p>
I love physical books, but what I love more is reading. I love reading so much that the boon of having a 300 book library in my pocket at all times trumps the tactile pleasure of owning physical books. Although I love being in libraries (personal and public), the amount of physical space that books consume is a serious deal breaker. 
</p>

<p>
On average I spend 1-2 hours a week in bookshops. Odd behavior for a digital-only reader, right? To me, bookshops have a new function as a browsing experience. It’s orders of magnitude more pleasurable than digital browsing. I love moving about a beautiful physical space that’s arranged thematically. I love cover art. I love physically handling books, and flicking through a few pages to get a taste for the language. I love the smell of books. I take the recommendations and curations of certain bookshops that I respect extremely seriously. 
</p>

<p>
Once I’ve decided that I want to read a book, I take a photo of it with my phone. I usually see others doing the same. Later (if I remember) I’ll flip through my photos and buy the Kindle version of the book on Amazon. This process is broken. The user experience should be streamlined. I want to be able to simply take the photo and have the Kindle version arrive moments later. I also want to pay some kind of a commission to the bookshop for providing the curation and the browsing experience.
</p>

<p>
My ideal bookshop would be optimized for this behavior. Rather than holding a lot of inventory and selling physical units, the bookshop would curate a 'display-only' shortlist of books, and take commission on digital sales.
