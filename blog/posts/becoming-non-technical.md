I wasn’t one of those kids - like many of you - who started programming at eight years old. Instead, gaming consumed me at that age. Commander Keen, Diablo and Quake held me in thrall. 

My first impulse to start programming was the impulse to make my own games. It came at around age twelve. I never got very far with it. In fact, I never got beyond a few bewildering tutorials on the Python REPL. I couldn’t see a path from those cryptic runes in my terminal, to the rich and fantastic worlds I explored in games.

My next collision with programming was in college. I was a freshman at Duke University in 2006 as Facebook began to explode. The impulse to program visited me again. This time it was a mercantile ambition; “if I learn to make apps like Facebook, I'll be rich!” And so in my freshman year I began to teach myself development in earnest.

Soon after, a few unexpected ideas began to bubble up from the murky soup of my beer-pong-addled psyche.

First, I came to believe that building things with code was something I could happily spend big chunks of my life doing. Maybe, I thought, I was taking the first toddling steps towards that most unattainable of things; a Passion.

Second, I realized that I found programming _itself_ interesting. Not just as a thing to do, but as a thing to study. I ended up doing a thesis about cellular automata at the end of my degree.

And third, I realized I could start making money _right now_, by being a freelance programmer. My first paid programming gig was building a Blackboard clone for the University of Conneticut as a Facebook app. 'Huskybook' didn't get much traction, I'm sad to say.

Straight out of college, I started working at a gaming company. Finally, I thought, I’m making games. Despite having a lot of fun, I [managed to end that episode in disaster](http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/how-i-fired-myself).

Over the next six years worked at various startups and even started two companies myself. I honed my craft and found that it was indeed a passion. I was never _very_ good. I was never a so-called 10x programmer.

And then, there was a minor apocalypse in my life, and I left the US, my home of almost 10 years. I moved to London, my birthplace, and drifted aimlessly for nearly six months. This post is the first one I've written since that moment, well over a year ago.

As the search for paid work finally and joltingly, commenced, I realized that I wasn’t looking for technical roles anymore. Why? I wasn’t sure. I just felt like I couldn’t go back to spending day after day writing code.

A friend from my old, now oddly distant, life in New York reached out to me. He convinced me to apply for a job at Palantir in London. He assumed that I'd apply for an engineering role. But to his (and my) surprise, I went for a non-technical role as a strategist. Later I would justify this decision as a desire to round out my skillset.

I got the job, and traded in my IDE for a never-empty inbox. I learned to Power Point and to Word. I overcame my fear of presenting to groups people. I developed the skill of translating technical concepts into simple, clear language, that everyone can understand.

In general, I became a better communicator. My ability to empathize with others increased, and I realized how incredibly low-EQ I had been before. I became more effective in my social life overall, most rewardingly in the world of dating.

Shockingly, I started to find engineers occasionally frustrating. Why couldn't they see that this just had to get done? Never mind technical debt .. we can adress that later. Why can't he see the bigger picture? All this minutiae is exhausting and distracting! Does every single thing _really_ need test coverage?

And my own technical abilities began to atrophy. I opened up a terminal one day to help shuffle some files between AWS boxes. I guiltily found myself having to google some basic unix commands. In tandem, I found myself less quantitatively nimble than I had been in the past. Had I ever been as numerically fluent as the engineers on my team?

After nearly a year of building my non-technical toolbelt, I realized I wasn't okay with the alarmingly rapid deterioration of my technical side. Drawing a line in the sand, I conssciously beame more involved in dev at work (unheard of in my role) and began to take on some side-projects.

And now I'm straddling this fence. This bi-partisan operating mode. It's darn uncomfortable. I suspect the straddling is - in itself - a muscle that can be built. Right now it's weak. At the heart of it, it's nothing more than the ability to context switch between modes without compromising the quality of work done. I can't help wonder if this is a worthwhile pursuit. Maybe I simply don't have the capacity to do this. Maybe I should just pick one mode and go deep on it. Which mode?
