    <i>Tell us why you chose that particular sunday sermon</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently making a lot of really big life decisions (mostly related to 
    work). Ultimately I want to pursue a path that will make me happy.
    I thought watching this video might help.

    <I>What did you learn?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Practical stuff: 
    <ul>
    <li>it's a very bad philosophy to encourage people to attempt stuff they're likely to fail at</li>
      <li>optimism - looking for the best aspects - it's almost biological to look at the worst things - evolutionary argument</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Esoteric Stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>ultimately we have the freedom to choose our own attitude</li>
      <li>acceptance of ourselves is absolutely crucial - and of others - and the ability to forgive</li>
      <li>meaning - a sense of meaning - comes from a sense of being related to something greater than ourselves - it's not completely natural - most humans think they're at the center of the universe</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>What, if anything, did you hear that youâ€™d consider incorporating into a system of 
    self-care as an idea, a method, a design constraint, etc. </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd like to make 'acceptance of something you hate about yourself' the desired behavior into a system.
    From personal experience I'm guessing that lack of self-acceptance causes boat loads of people to be 
    miserable.
