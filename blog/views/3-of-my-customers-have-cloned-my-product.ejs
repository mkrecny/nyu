<p>
	My current product has been cloned 3 times. It's less than a year old. It's been pretty rough, especially because all of the cloners  are ex-customers.
</p>	
<p>
Each time, I feel anger and outrage. Then betrayal. Anxiety follows; "what if this is better than my product?" Next, self-loathing; "how did I allow this to happen?!" Finally, I sink into apathy.
</p>
<p>
  I don't mind that their app does exactly the same thing as mine. Or that I could lose business over it. It's that they've slavishly copied the minor details that I'm so proud of. Things like the exact wording of a headline, the structure of a menu or an entire screenshot.
</p>
<p>
	In each case, I've had a conversation with the cloner. These conversations are not fun, but through them, I've learned a little about the 'cloner psyche'. The following conversations are real excerpts from emails.
	</p>
<p>
	<u>Psyche 1: "The Incredulous"</u>
</p>
<p>
	The Incredulous made a very close copy of my product. He ripped a screenshot from my splash page that contained my Twitter avatar and my full name. Then photoshopped his face in place of mine,  but left my name. When I asked him about it he replied:
</p>	
<p>
"<i>I thought entrepreneurs were always willing to help and learn from one another... what's the difference if I used that screenshot or another screenshot?? I was just in rapid prototyping mode...</i>"
</p>	
<p>
	<u>Psyche 2: "The Generous"</u>
</p>
<p>
	The Generous had been a customer since the very early days. He runs a Chicago based marketing agency. He was a serial discount-requester. He pulled off a pretty horrific Twitter Bootstraporific clone, and then was nice enough to make me a sweet offer:
</p>
<p>
	<u>The Generous:</u> <i>"I took it upon myself to build a tiny version that had just the features that I wanted ... but if it happens that our future plans align, I'd be interested to talk to you about helping meet some mutual needs here.  That includes the development of x, y, and z. I have 10 years of pretty successful business experience, and a 5-person account team of marketing specialists to donate time from, and agency clientele lined up."</i>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Psyche 3: "The Stealthy"</u>
</p>
<p>
	The Stealthy was a customer for about 4 months. We exchanged some emails, and I remember thinking that he was cool. He was incredibly surreptitious about setting up his clone, and left only  the tiniest of breadcrumbs leading from the clone, back to him. His clone is definitely the best one I've seen so far. The dahsboard is identically laid out and entire informational pages are basically copied. I wasn't 100% sure it was him, so I took a stab in the dark:
</p>
<p>
	<u>Me:</u> <i>"example.com? that's you right?"</i>
</p>
<p>
	<u>The Stealthy:</u> <i>"Yes I put it together."</i>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Me:</u> <i>"Feels very much like a clone of my product."</i>
</p>
<p>
	<u>The Stealthy:</u> <i>"Fair. I'm familiar with your work and they have similarities, so I won't entirely dispute that. I'm in the process of writing some new code that I expect will evolve it in a different, more blue ocean direction (and away from the user experience & benefit being driven entirely by x, y and z), but again, the underlying principle (particularly in current form) shares many things with your product."</i>
</p>
<p>
	But after all my pseudo-psychology, I still don't get the cloner mentality. We've all had, "I wish I'd thought of that" moments. Most of us have had, "I thought of that ages ago" moments. But, "I want to copy that" moments? No sir, not me. I want to make a buck as much as the next person, but in the process, I need to believe that I'm building something original, even if I'm not.
</p>
<p>
	Have you been cloned?
