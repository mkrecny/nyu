<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> Hey .. you&#39;ve been pretty silent lately. Is everything okay?</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> Yeah, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve just been really busy. With my new role, and stuff, y&#39;know?</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> I suppose. It&#39;s just, we used to talk a lot more. Did I do something to upset you?</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> No, no! Totally not. I&#39;m just like, trying new things, trying to think bigger picture and whatnot.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> Oh. Bigger picture? Are our conversations not big picture?</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> Well yeah, of course. I love our conversations, you know that. They are big picture, within implementation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> I see. So .. big picture within the tiny box that is implementation. Has it ever occurred to you that basically everything is implementation?</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> Um. Strategizing. Designing. Selling. Building relationships. These things aren&#39;t implementation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> Those things <em>are</em> implementation. You&#39;re just implementing with a different toolset or language.</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> Well, in any case .. I feel like when we spend all of our time talking I being to think in a very monochromatic way. And that&#39;s limiting.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> Okay well how about this. Your technical side is atrophying. All that EQ you&#39;re building seems to be coming at a cost.</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> Perhaps. But it&#39;s worth it. My new role is forcing me to be a better communicator. And to be more empathetic. Do you realize how healthy this has been for me socially? How nourishing?</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> I&#39;ll miss you</p>
<p><img src="/images/person.svg"> You too. We can still hang out on the weekends right?.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code.svg"> Right.</p>
