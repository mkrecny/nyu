	  Don't build something that has Awesome UX&trade;. Instead, build something that has no UX.
  </p>

  <!--<p>
	  Leave the truly beautiful apps to funded startup teams. Their dedicated designers and front end 'ninjas', will beat you at Awesome UX&trade; while you scrabble to do the jobs of five people. 
  </p>-->

  <p>
	  Seriously. The less time the user spends engaging with your product, the better.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Build a tool that will deploy a fleet of industrious worker processes. These processes should be automating some labor intensive task for your customers. You'll be saving them time and money. (The workers probably won't be written in Rails.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't build a CRUD app that relies on a large network of users to deliver any value.
  </p>

  <p>
	 Most importantly, don't make your users click around on your HTML to get value out of your product. 
  </p>

  <!--<p>
	  The only time that they should be using your website is to put in their credit card details. Then they go back to their (now easier) life.
  </p>-->

  <p>
	  Slice away at the surface area of your product until there's nothing left but a sharp edged results generating engine.
  </p>
