	  Don't build something that has AwesomeUX&trade;. Instead, build something that has no UX.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Leave the truly beautiful apps to funded startup teams. Their dedicated designers and front end 'ninjas', will beat you at AwesomeUX&trade; while you scrabble to do the jobs of five people. 
  </p>

  <p>
	  Build a tool that does work invisibly, in the background. Seriously. The less time the user spends engaging with your product, the better.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Your tool will deploy industrious worker processes that automate some gnarly job for your customers. They won't be written in Rails.
   </p>
   <p>
    Take hard, costly and boring work off of your customers' plates. Don't build a CRUD app that relies on a large network of users to deliver any value.
  </p>

  <p>
	 Most importantly, don't make your users click around on your HTML to get value out of your product. 
  </p>

  <!--<p>
	  The only time that they should be using your website is to put in their credit card details. Then they go back to their (now easier) life.
  </p>-->

  <p>
	  Slice away at the surface area of your product until there's nothing left but a sharp edged results generating engine.
