<p>
  In an world where the body is becoming increasibly measurable,
  in what stead do traditional doctors stand?
</p>

<p>
  My belief is that people like Smarr could ultimately do a better job
  of disease diagnoses than traditional doctors, and more importantly
  could really implement a path toward's Hood's 'P4' conception of medicine.
</p>

<p>
  But the amazing thing about software is that, unlike doctors, it scales.
</p>

<p>
  It's great for Smarr to crowdsource his bio-data, in the hope that 
  other experts will catch something he missed, and offer assistance,
  but Smarr should really be open-sourcing his software.
</p>

<p>
  Right now two big factors prohibiting the everyman being
  a patient of the future, like Smarr, are technical skill and cost.
</p>

<p>
  Smarr should assist in removing one hurdle (technical skill) by releasing his 
  algorithms either as a cheap / free SaaS product - or as open source
  software
