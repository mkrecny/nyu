  I couldn't find a plastic funnel, so taped the edges of the coffee filter to
  my mason jar.

  through into the jar, I pulled off the filter and poured in the rubbing alcohol
  (after taking a healthy swig).

  Clouds of DNA began to rise.

  Extraction with a skewer. I am shocked by how robust these
  clumpy strands are.
