The Emerging Mind
-----------------
-----------------

> civilization has been having trouble with the concept of 'mind' for centuries
> no one has offered a definition of what the mind actually is

Why does it even matter?
> the lack of a definition has paralyzed us in many ways
-- education - can't educate students on what the mind actually is - no definition
-- psychotherapists -- 
-- 95% of ppl in the field of mental health - education - phil - don't know what the mind is
-- none of these fields have a definition of the mind ("that's why we're studying it" || "we don't want to")

> without a definition of the subject of your profession - how can you operate

>> so offering a def of the mind, MIGHT HELP

- what's the connection between the mind and the brain?
>> the mind is NOT just the activity of the brain

>> "the mind is just brain activity" - is actually quite destructive - a MYTH
- innacurate - not complete

-- HOW? - 
1. ppl think early dev shapes all
a. the brain is something that finishes growing by the time you're a teenager
b. so if i'm an adult 'What can I do' my mind was already defined in my teenage years
... but we know that the brain continues to dev
... and if you have a def of the mind you can change how to brain funcs

so he's saying that 'mind === brain activity' is bad as ppl have this misconception
but it's the misconception that's bad - not the (non-fact) that you're predefined by teens

2. if the brain is the structure and the mind comes out of it - determined by genes
- i'm basically stuck with what my parents gave me

3. evolution
there's a misconception that evolution selects for competitiveness
evolution defines our genes - our genes define our brain therefore we're mean competitive creatures


BY OFFERING A (DIFFERENT) DEFINITION OF THE MIND
- you can empower people
- the embodied brain - a distributed nervous system - not just in the skull
- neurons (and supporting 'glial' cells)
- neuros 100bn in the head
- the avg neuron in the head ('nodal point') has 10000 other connections (trillions of cntctns in the brain)
- how does one neuron communicate with another - electro-chemical energy flow (flow is change across time)
- so the number of firing patterns - on/off combinations - binary state permutations == 10^1000000
- a larger number than the # of KNOWN atoms in the universe
- what is in your head is constantly the connections - neurons getting new neighbors (how does that happen?)
... thus the number of 'firing patterns' is virtually infinite

> we can grow myelin sheaths (conductive, new synaptic connections, grow new neurons)
... via both GENETICS and XP

> mirror neurons - you can predict stuff you've seen before..
- thru an understanding of mirror neurons, and the mapping out of intention
you can feel - your inner system - is making a map of another's inner system

THIS INNER SENSTION THAT WE CALL 'MIND' IS PROFOUNDLY SOCIAL

SO MY DEFINITION OF 'MIND' is : 
satisfied the criteria of scientists from many disciplines
the mind can be defined as AN EMBODIED AND RELATIONAL PROCESS THAT REGULATES (22)
THE FLOW OF ENERGY AND INFORMATION THIS ASPECT OF MIND (BEYOND CONS AND SUBJ)
-- IT'S EMBODIED THROUGHT THE WHOLE BODY
--- IT'S RELATIONAL: not something that emanets only within you
-- self organizing property of a complex system

- self-organization - a real mathematical concept - applying this concept to a human life
-- how does self-organization move energy and information flow

@ 25:15

mind sight: picking up all the details of energy and info flow in myself and others
we can train the mind to change the function and structure of the brain

if you look @ systems that are functioning well - there's a sense of harmony - adaptiveness - flexibility
health is :
'health is a state of flexibility, adaptibility, coherence, function, stable, flow 
... emerges with integration ... the linkage of differentiated parts ... self organization
to maximize complexity (in the mathematical sense)
harmony (as in harmony in a choir) - differentiated individuals (their own voice)
integrating with others - in a 'harmonious' way
any process that promotes integration, promotes health
inc telemere length
inc mental presence -> telemores
integration is health & if you take on this def of mind, new opps for wellbeing will be
be available to you (personal, interpersonal, relational, societal, planetary)
