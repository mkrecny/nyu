<p>
  What really struck me from this video was not so much Wolf's comments on surveillance - but his observation that
  there are really two 'institutionalizations' of the QS/DIY Health movements.
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Companies creating QS products/devices (e.g. Zeo)</li>
    <li>People 'hacking' QS products/devices and <i>data</i></li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately I think it's really important for companies/product creators (category 1)
  to make their products/data, hackable and accessible - more so than in other types
  of products. That's because the data produced from QS products is incredibly personal
  and, in theory, extremely relevant to the health of the data interpreter. 
</p>
<p>
  I'd love to see devices be platforms that create data - each having an API and 
  its own app ecosystem. Device makers should specialize in making awesome hardware,
  and having the output from that hardware be persisted in an information-rich way
  with a great API. Let the imagination of hackers and entrepreneurs create a proliferation
  of hacks and software products on-top of that data.
