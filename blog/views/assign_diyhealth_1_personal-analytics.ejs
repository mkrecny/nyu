    The Personal Analytics of My Life</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>

  I think the advent of APIs - for things like twitter, facebook and gmail -
  makes doing personal analytics a lot easier than it was before. We're all
  entrenched, pouring our lives into these platforms. Without realizing it we have created
  a profusion of opportunities to do personal analytics.
</p>

<p>
  For example, here's a little bit of self-analysis I did on my tweeting habits. It 
  shows the total number of tweets I've made on each day of the week since I joined twitter
  nearly 2 years ago.

<p>
  What worries me about these platforms is that they're products. You don't
  actually own your data like Wolfram does. One day these companies might go
  away and so will you data - and your opportunity for self-tracking. I think
  the only 'safe' way to do this kind of digital self-tracking is to learn how
  to code and do it yourself. E.g. you should be exporting your tweets, emails and 
  facebook data on a regular basis - and saving them to a disk that you
  own, not a disk that you rent.
</p>

<p>
  Here's some code that I wrote to export all your tweets using node.js.

  Below I've responded to some of the stuff that stood out to me in the Wolfram
  article
</p>

<p>
  <i>
    "It was easier just to keep everything than to worry 
    about what specifically was worth keeping."
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  It strikes me that this logical, but probably uncommon attitude is the 
  main reason why Wolfram is such a successful example
  in personal analytics. Also, given that he spends most of his day
  providing input to a digital system and has hardcore technical skills,
  personal analytics is relatively easy for him.
</p>

<p>
  <i>
    "Every dayâ€”in an effort at 'self-awareness', I have 
    automated systems send me a few emails about the day before."
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  I'm sad that Wolfram doesn't go into more detail on this. The use of 
  inverted commas around 'self-awareness' implies that he almost doesn't
  take the concept of self-awareness too seriously. I wonder if this system 
  creates a sense of long-term trends over time, or if you only 
  remember the last few days.
</p>

<p>
  <i>
    "The more routine I can make the basic practical aspects of my life, 
    the more I am able to be energetic and spontaneous about intellectual 
    and other things."
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  That's an extremely powerful hypothesis, and to me, the most interesting 
  concept in this article. However, Wolfram doesn't dive in to how he
  used his data to 'routineize' the practical aspects of his life. 
  This is something I'd really like more color on.
</p>

<p>
  <i>
    "For me one of the objectives is to have ideas, and hopefully 
    good ones. so can personal analytics help me measure the rate 
    at which that happens?"
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  I wonder how Wolfram would act upon such data. The way I imagine it
  is something like this. He notices that at a certain period in his life,
  the rate at which he had new ideas was uncommonly high. Then he drills into
  all sorts of other data from that period, and attempts to determine why
  his ideation rate was so high at that time. From there he would go about 
  recreating those conditions - and thus have lots of new ideas. Imagine a 
  system that could do that analysis automatically, and introduce the favorable
  conditions into your life without you even being aware of it.
