<img src="/images/code.svg"> Hey .. you've been pretty silent lately. Is everything okay?

<img src="/images/person.svg"> Yeah, I'm sorry. I've just been really busy. With my new role, and stuff, y'know?

<img src="/images/code.svg"> I suppose. It's just, we used to talk a lot more. Did I do something to upset you?

<img src="/images/person.svg"> No, no! Totally not. I'm just like, trying new things, trying to think bigger picture and whatnot.

<img src="/images/code.svg"> Oh. Bigger picture? Are our conversations not big picture?

<img src="/images/person.svg"> Well yeah, of course. I love our conversations, you know that. They are big picture, within implementation.

<img src="/images/code.svg"> I see. So .. big picture within the tiny box that is implementation. Has it ever occurred to you that basically everything is implementation?

<img src="/images/person.svg"> Um. Strategizing. Designing. Selling. Building relationships. These things aren't implementation.

<img src="/images/code.svg"> Those things _are_ implementation. You're just implementing with a different toolset or language.

<img src="/images/person.svg"> Well, in any case .. I feel like when we spend all of our time talking I being to think in a very monochromatic way. And that's limiting.

<img src="/images/code.svg"> Okay well how about this. Your technical side is atrophying. All that EQ you're building seems to be coming at a cost.

<img src="/images/person.svg"> Perhaps. But it's worth it. My new role is forcing me to be a better communicator. And to be more empathetic. Do you realize how healthy this has been for me socially? How nourishing?

<img src="/images/code.svg"> I'll miss you

<img src="/images/person.svg"> You too.
