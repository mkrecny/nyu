	  Don't build something that has Awesome UX&trade;. Instead, build something that has no UX.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Either way, funded startups will beat you at Awesome UX&trade; while you scrabble to do the jobs of five people. 
  </p>

  <p>
	  Build a tool that will deploy a fleet of industrious worker processes. These processes should automate some gnarly task for your customers. You'll be saving them time and money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please don't build another CRUD app that relies on a large network of users to deliver any value.
  </p>

  <p>
	 Most importantly, don't make your users click around on your HTML to get value out of your product.
   </p>

   <p>
	 Slice away at its surface area until there's nothing left but a sharp edged results generating engine.
